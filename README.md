# Null bugs
Repository for reporting issues on various websites

When I encounter bugs on websites I visit, I report them so they get fixed. Frankly, they rarely do get fixed so I thought - why not publish the bug reports? This way hopefully the pressure to fix them will increase and additionally I will show off my skills in finding bugs and perhaps even showcase some more interesting ones.
